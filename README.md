## 🧠 Model & Approach

- Data cleaning: Fill missing values, encode categorical features
- Feature engineering: Age groups, family size, title extraction
- Algorithms used:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Evaluation: Accuracy score, cross-validation
- Final output: Submission file with predicted survival labels
